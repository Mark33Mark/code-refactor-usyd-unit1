### 1. Description  
**What is this project?**  
* An on the job ticket.  

**Why this project?**  
* The client, Horiseon, requested improving the accessibility rating of their website.  Accessible sites rank higher in search engines.  Horiseon are a SEO marketing agency and high accessibility ratings are critical to their credibility and reputation because accessible sites rank higher in search engines.

**What problem does this project solve?**  
* Improve the sites Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) by improving it's accessibility rating.
* The code has been tidied up and annotated to communicate every change.
* Some performance improvements have been implemented like adjusting image sizes so the page renders quicker and testing all hyperlinks are functioning and fixing if required.

**Lessons learnt?**  
* In future I will consider using [webAIM](https://usyd.watsonised.com) to assess colour contrast quicker for accessibility compliance / improvements.
* Compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) has not been tested.  [The WCAG contrast standard. ](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=141%2C143#contrast-minimum) however using the browser's developer tool, a thorough scan of the elements has been carried out.
